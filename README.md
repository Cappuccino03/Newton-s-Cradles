# Newton-s-Cradles
Welcome to a virtual simulation of Newton's Cradle, a classic physics experiment that elegantly demonstrates the principles of conservation of momentum and energy. In this representation, we've used HTML for the structure and CSS for styling and animation to recreate the mesmerizing motion of swinging metal spheres.
Here you can see the work- newtonscradle.netlify.app

Explore the virtual Newton's Cradle, and observe how the swinging motion of one ball initiates a chain reaction, showcasing the fundamental principles of physics in an interactive and visually appealing manner. Feel free to experiment with the code and customize it to create your unique representation of this iconic physics experiment!

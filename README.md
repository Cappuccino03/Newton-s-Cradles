# Newton-s-Cradles
Welcome to a virtual simulation of Newton's Cradle, a classic physics experiment that elegantly demonstrates the principles of conservation of momentum and energy. In this representation, we've used HTML for the structure and CSS for styling and animation to recreate the mesmerizing motion of swinging metal spheres.
